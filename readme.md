Uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) with no plug-ins. I chose APIs that didn't require any authentication for simplicity (albeit usefulness is very low).

## Start
Run `node server.js` to start web server. Navigate to http://localhost:8081 to view.

## Use
Enter a term into the Search field to get a list of books that match from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/), for example "Lord of the Rings". Author names, ISBN's, or just about any other term can be used in the search.

Within the search results click on an author name or ISBN to do a new search for the author or ISBN. Click on a title to bring up more details about that book.
